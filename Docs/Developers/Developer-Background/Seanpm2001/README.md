## Developers

### Developer background

#### Seanpm2001

I [`@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) am the one who started this project. <!-- I might have to hand off development to someone else almost entirely, as culinary is the lowest tier on my skill tree. !--> I originally felt that I might have to hand off development to someone else almost entirely, as culinary is the lowest tier on my skill tree, but I feel I can still manage this project. I still need more developers with experience.

I started this project on 2022, Thursday, June 23rd, as a private repository. The name of the project came to me in a dream the week before, and I developed the concept from there. I decided to write the project in Gherkin, as I don't have very many projects in this language (this project becoming the second one) and also because it would be a good challenge, and would be a good language for the project.
