## Programming languages

### Gherkin

#### Gherkin usage

I chose Gherkin for this project, as:

- [x] I don't have very many projects in this language at the moment
- [x] It offers a challenge for development
- [x] Its name best fits the food theme of the project
- [x] It is still supportable

Gherkin is also the name of a pickle, and pickles are commonly found in some sandwiches. I didn't choose AppleScript, as it would be limited, and who has apples in their sandwiches to begin with?

##### [From the project language file](/PROJECT_LANG_1.feature)

I decided to have Gherkin as the 1st project language for this project (WichCraft) as it is the most suitable programming language name for this project, as a Gherkin is something very commonly found in sandwiches and burgers. It is also a very functional language. It is being written in Gherkin both for software diversity reasons, and as a challenge. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
